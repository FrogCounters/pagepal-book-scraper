    "\n",
    "It is a new bonnet. This is the first time I have worn it. I hope it looks all right. \n",
    "\n",
    "I must practice sitting up straight and proper just for a minute. I want the Queen to know that I am a fine lady. \n",

    "\n",
    "I am glad of that, for I do not like ribbons. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NO PARTY FOR ME \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How strange it is that some of us _want_ to go to the party, and some _do not_ want to go. Some of us _can_ go, and some _cannot_ go. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am one who _wants_ to go, and I am one who _cannot_ go. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have a sick head. It aches. Perhaps I caught too many mice last night. \n",
    "\n",
    "The doctor has been here. He told me to take this medicine every half-hour. \n",

    "\n",
    "I\u2019m the only cat in our country who has an automobile. \n",
    "\n",
    "But I suppose all the fine cats will be having them soon. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is really great fun to ride faster than any cat or kitten can run. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would invite you to ride too, but there is room for only one. \n",

    "\n",
    "I am sure I should be killed! \n",

    "\n",
    "Nearly two pounds? \n",
    "\n",
    "You don\u2019t mean it! \n",
