##Analysis Files

The files here were designed for scraping books from the Gutenberg online repository. It uses direct calls to the Expert AI API weblinks to disambiguate and analyse these books. This data is then formatted and sent to the firebase for the website to publish it's catalogue of books. Hence, the running of this script is independent of the availability of the main website.
