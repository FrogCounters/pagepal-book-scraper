TO FRITZ
WHO LOVES KITTENS AND CATS AS MUCH AS YOU AND I DO
[v]
[1]
[2]
I am the Queen of all the Kittens.
I am the Queen! the Queen!
Come, all you kittens and cats.
Hear what I have to say.
To-morrow I give a grand party.
The party will be in my palace.
You are all invited from the biggest to
the littlest, from the oldest to the youngest,
from the blackest to the whitest.
So wash your paws and shine your fur.
Forget your naughty tricks and do not
one of you dare be late to your Queen’s
party.
To-morrow at one o’clock.
[3]
IT IS MY PARTY
[4]
I am Granny Gray.
I am very, very old, but I am going to
the Queen’s party.
I am grandmother to a great many
kittens.
When any of them are naughty their
mothers always send for me.
When any of them are sick I always
know what to do.
I teach them how to sing.
I teach them how to scratch.
I teach them how to catch mice.
I am very, very old.
They call me Granny Gray.
[5]
I AM GRANNY GRAY
[6]
Hark, hark! what is that noise?
No, I cannot play with you now.
I must take my bath.
I must get ready for the party.
I have a new jacket and a new hat to
wear.
My pants were new last week, but they
are not new now.
I tore two holes in them when I climbed
the apple tree in the back yard.
Mother patched them, but someway the
patches show more than the holes did.
Perhaps my new jacket will cover the
patches. I hope I shall look well dressed.
[7]
I AM TAKING MY BATH
[8]
Mew! mew! mew! mew!
Come, mother, come quickly!
We are all ready and waiting to start.
Yes, we are all here.
There are one, two, three, four of us.
The carriage is pretty small, but we
think we can all get in.
We will be good this time and not
push each other out.
But please do come quickly, mother.
It is hard to sit so still.
Mew! mew! mew! mew!
[9]
WE ARE ALL HERE
[10]
Dear me! my kittens are in such a
hurry! They give me no time to dress.
It takes a very long time to shine my
fur and to fix my bonnet.
It is a new bonnet. This is the first time
I have worn it. I hope it looks all right.
I must practice sitting up straight and
proper just for a minute. I want the
Queen to know that I am a fine lady.
I hope my kittens will not rough up
their fur. If they do I shall have to
shine it all over again.
Now we must start.
Where is their father?
[11]
I HAVE A NEW BONNET
[12]
Here I am. Yes, I am the father of
those four fine kittens.
They are such beautiful kittens their
mother does not even tie ribbons around
their necks.
I am glad of that, for I do not like
ribbons.
I must go now and take them all to
the Queen’s palace. I am sure they will
be the handsomest kittens there.
I suppose I shall have to push their
carriage.
Come, mother, let us be off. Are my
whiskers stiff? Is my hat on straight?
[13]
WAITING FOR THE CHILDREN
[14]
Don’t tell anybody where I am.
I am hiding away from mother.
She wants me to go to the Queen’s
party and I don’t want to go.
I don’t like the Queen, she is so grand
and dignified.
She frightens me.
I would rather hide in this pitcher all
day than go to the Queen’s palace.
Please don’t tell where I am.
You will not, will you?
[15]
DON’T TELL ANYBODY
[16]
How strange it is that some of us want
to go to the party, and some do not want
to go. Some of us can go, and some cannot
go.
I am one who wants to go, and I am
one who cannot go.
I have a sick head. It aches. Perhaps
I caught too many mice last night.
The doctor has been here. He told me
to take this medicine every half-hour.
How I wish I could go to the party!
They surely will have something good
to eat there, but I must stay at home and
take my medicine.
[17]
I HAVE A SICK HEAD
[18]
I’m off for the Queen’s palace.
I’m the only cat in our country who
has an automobile.
But I suppose all the fine cats will be
having them soon.
It is really great fun to ride faster
than any cat or kitten can run.
I would invite you to ride too, but
there is room for only one.
So, good-bye!
I’m off for the Queen’s party.
[19]
IN MY AUTOMOBILE
[20]
Yes, I am being weighed.
It frightens me to hang in the air like
this.
What if I should fall, with my feet
tied up in this bag!
I am sure I should be killed!
Can you see how much I weigh?
Nearly two pounds?
You don’t mean it!
Then I am big enough to go to the
party all alone, though I am not sure
that I want to go.
I think I had rather stay at home and
play.
[21]
HOW MUCH DO I WEIGH?
[22]
Attention, kittens and cats! The clock
strikes one. The Queen’s party has begun.
I am the Commanding Officer of the
palace. Attention to what I have to say!
Our Queen bids you welcome.
She waits for you in her throne room.
As you each pass in you must salute
her and recite for her a cat tale, a rat
tale, or some other tale, long or short, true
or not.
But no fears or tears, for our Queen
has a fine dinner in her grand dining-room
for all brave kittens and cats.
Now who has the best tale?
[23]
I’VE A FEATHER IN MY CAP
[24]
We are here to bring great news, O
Queen!
We are here to bring great news!
Do you know—!
Do you know—!
[25]
BREAKING THE NEWS
[26]
I am a famous singer among kittens
and cats. I sing in the kitten choir and
in big concerts.
I wear a French bonnet when I sing.
My voice is very soft and very sweet.
I have come here to-day to sing for my
Queen.
[27]
THE SWEET SINGER
[28]
Listen, O Queen, to this tale of a mouse!
And we gobbled him up.
So, dear Queen, no mouse shall trouble
your party while we two brave cats are
here.
[29]
TWO BRAVE CATS
[30]
I’m the nurse who takes care of kittens
and cats when they are sick.
Sometimes they eat too much and have
the stomach-ache.
Sometimes they fall down stairs and
bump their heads.
Sometimes they get their tails bitten
by bad dogs.
Then their mothers send for me and I
take care of them until they are well.
I always wear a white dress and a
white bonnet.
If you ever get sick just send for me
and I will take care of you.
[31]
A LITTLE NURSE
[32]
I am a famous mouser. I have caught
more mice than any other cat.
I can see them afar off.
I can hear them afar off.
I can scent them afar off.
They are all afraid of me.
They scurry away whenever they see
me coming.
I wear soft pads on the bottom of my
feet so they cannot hear me.
I keep my teeth white and sharp.
My friends call me ‘the Mouse Trap.’
But I know a Kitty who is not a good
mouser. I will tell you about her.
[33]
This is my story:—
A LONG TIME AGO
No mouse ever slipped through my
paws like that, I am glad to say.
I am a great mouser.
Yes, I am a famous mouser, O Queen!
[35]
‘THE MOUSE TRAP’
[36]
The other day in school I couldn’t do
my sums.
I couldn’t tell how many two and two
make.
I couldn’t read my lesson.
I couldn’t say my A B C’s.
I couldn’t sing my song.
So the teacher made me stand on a
stool. Then she put this cap on my head.
I have had to wear it ever since.
After this I am going to study hard.
I don’t like to be called a dunce.
I don’t like to sit on a stool.
Would you?
[37]
YES, I AM A DUNCE
[38]
We will tell you a tale of ourselves, dear
Queen. A tale of three little kittens.
[40]
THE KITTENS THAT LOST THEIR MITTENS
[41]
MEE-OW, MEE-OW
[42]
One day it rained and we could not
go out of doors.
So my brothers and sisters and I played
Hide and Seek in the attic.
All of a sudden one of my brothers
said, ‘I’ll tell you what let’s do!’
‘What’s that?’ we all asked together.
‘Let’s dress up! It’s lots of fun.’
So we ran to the closet where father
and mother keep their Sunday clothes.
I put on father’s trousers, and now I
wear them every day.
My brothers and sisters laugh at me.
But I think I look fine, don’t you!

THE HERO
[46]
[47]
HEY! DIDDLE, DIDDLE
[48]
Listen, O Queen! to my wonderful tale.
I have thought and counted, and
counted and thought, but I cannot tell
how many were going to St. Ives.
Can you help me, wise Queen?
[49]
ON THE WAY TO ST. IVES
[50]
I am called Little Fairy.
Would you know that I am only a
kitten, dear Queen?
Even the mice do not know it, for
they play with me and we have fine
frolics together.
One day a little mouse told me just
where to find his house.
If he had known that I was a real,
live kitten, I am sure he never would
have told me.
Would you like to know where the
little mouse lives? A friend was with
me and she will tell you. Listen!
[51]
THEY CALL ME LITTLE FAIRY
[52]
Yes, listen to my wonderful secret!
[53]
I KNOW A SECRET
[54]
I have a strange tale, O Queen.
The other day I found a round glass.
An old man was looking into the glass,
so I looked in, and guess what I saw.
I saw a cat looking straight at me.
His face was white just like mine.
His eyes had black spots in them just
like mine, and his whiskers were long
just like mine.
When I said ‘Mew!’ he said ‘Mew!’
When I moved my paw, he moved his
paw.
When I ran away, he ran away too, so
I never have found out who he was.
[55]
BEHIND THE LOOKING-GLASS

[57]
MY PUSSY’S IN THE WELL
[58]
[59]
PUSSY-CAT MEW
[60]
[61]
PRIZE-WINNERS
[62]
Once I was a ’fraid-cat, dear Queen.
All the kittens and cats laughed at
me and sang this song about me.
[63]
MY COURAGE DID FAIL
[64]
I came from the land of the snow,
from the land of the Eskimo, where the
summer is all day and the winter is all
night.
We dress in fur coats up there.
It’s cold, so cold one can hardly wink.
But I am proud of my land, for the
North Pole is there.
The dogs have seen it. They tell us
so.
And what the dogs say is true, you
know.
[65]
A LITTLE ESKIMO
[66]
We are twin kittens.
There are two of us, and we look just
alike.
Our brothers and sisters cannot tell us
apart.
Even our mother cannot tell us apart.
When one of us says “Mew!” the
other says “Mew!”
When one is hungry, the other is
hungry.
When one is sleepy, the other is sleepy.
We are afraid, dear Queen, that we are
beginning to be sleepy right now.
We have had such fun at your party!
[67]
TWO SLEEPY KITTENS
[68]
We are twins too, and they say we
look alike.
We are so hungry just now we simply
cannot tell you a tale.
But we will sing you a song,—if we
can think of one.
[69]
WE’RE FEELING QUITE EMPTY
[70]
Ding, dong, bell!
We have something to tell!
All you kittens and cats who have told
tales of rats, or of mice, or of cats, and
have made our Queen laugh, listen!
The Queen bids you come to the grand
dining-room. There a dinner she spreads
which may quite turn your heads.
Heed what we say and we’ll show you
the way.
Ding, dong, bell!
[71]
DING, DONG, BELL
[72]
Oh my! What a fine dining-room, and
how many tables there are!
Each cat has a table all to himself. I
wonder why.
There is the Queen sitting at the end
of the room.
She is looking straight at me.
Oh dear! What if I should spill my
milk on this white cloth!
What would the Queen say to me!
I am almost afraid to drink it.
It is so hard to drink out of china cups.
But I must try.
[73]
THE QUEEN IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME
[74]
I wish some one would hurry and bring
me some milk.
Mine is all gone and so is my mouse.
I wonder if this is all we are going to
have to eat.
I am so hungry I shall have to go home
and catch a rat.
The Queen is asking some one to tell
a story. I believe she means me.
Yes, dear Queen, I will tell you a story
about seven little pussy-cats who were
not so polite as we are. But first may I
please have a little more milk to drink?
(My tale is coming.)

SH-H-H

When a new school Reader comes to the hands of the primary
teacher, she naturally asks: “Will this book give to my class of
boys and girls a healthy stimulus of thought and pleasure? Will
they receive through it valuable instruction and assistance in the
mechanics of reading? Is the book sufficiently literary in style and
artistic in form to command the respect and love of the children?
Is it suggestive, dramatic, and ethically healthful? In a word, is it
worth the precious time of the schoolroom?”
To the inquiring teacher who may examine this little book, which
is devoted entirely to the frolics and fancies of kittens and cats, the
following remarks may reveal a definite educational purpose and
value in it.
Following the example of Mother Goose, the wise and classic
rhymester of the nursery, we have taken a subject dear to the heart
of childhood and have given it life and personality in the simple and
unsophisticated manner of the child.
Many of the happiest playtime experiences of children are associated
with their kittens. They delight to dress the frolicsome yet
docile little creatures in doll gowns and jackets, and give them long
rides in doll carriages, and make them sit at tiny tables and share in
tea parties, then put them to bed and perhaps give them water medicine
for an imaginary ill. Can there be a more normal and healthy
pastime for a little child than this?
In one respect kittens take precedence over dolls. They are alive.[82]
They must be treated kindly. They will not bear the abuse and neglect
given to many beautiful dolls. They demand attention and
companionship, and they return a real devotion for kindness and
care. Therefore we love them, and especially do our children love
them and delight in stories or pictures of them.
Those of us who have had glimpses of the child heart and mind
know that stories of kittens and queens and parties yield much the
same delight to the little reader of juvenile fiction, as do adventure
and romance to the grown-up reader.
This simple story about the Queen of the Kitten Country and the
party which she gives in her palace, ought, therefore, to meet one of
the most important requirements for a higher first grade school
Reader, that of a strong appeal to the child in subject matter and
illustration. With the interest keenly aroused the difficulties in
learning to read are mastered quickly and with pleasure. However,
the following brief suggestions are given to assist any teacher who
may need them in making use of the book to the greatest advantage
for her class.
Before the reading of the book is begun there might well be one
or two story-telling periods. Each child should be encouraged to tell
a story, from his own experience if possible, about a kitten, or a
party, or to give his idea of a queen.
The children should be assisted in recalling and in learning Mother
Goose rhymes and other verses about cats. Give them several blackboard
drawing lessons showing cats in different positions and costumes.
A frieze of kittens may be started at the top of the blackboard,[83]
adding each new kitten character to the row as the story
progresses. This frieze will furnish material for several varieties of
“busy work.”
A valuable exercise to stimulate thought and facility of expression
is to assign a short page for a child to read silently, which he later
gives aloud in his own words before the teacher and class.
Interesting and profitable reviews may be frequently had by assigning
a cat character to each child, having them read in order the
text devoted to their special character. The first review of this kind
may well occur at the end of page twenty, where the preparations
for the party are completed. When the party is over a final review
may be given in dramatic form. The children should impersonate
the different cats and tell their tales to amuse the Queen, who sits
on her throne. This final dramatic review would naturally begin
with the call of the Commanding Officer on page twenty-two. Each
child should memorize his part and give it with spontaneous expression
and action. Slight costuming may be prepared if desired, or the
blackboard frieze may furnish the cat pictures, while the children
give life and action to them.
Other special and valuable reviews may be developed from the
large amount of verse in the book, each child choosing a favorite
verse to read or recite or to illustrate on the blackboard. The children
should be encouraged to make rhyming sentences and word
lists of their own, using the fundamental thought or words in the
day’s lesson as a basis. From such rhymes and lists of rhyming
words, phonic work may be developed as the teacher chooses.
There are about six hundred words in the vocabulary of “Kittens
and Cats,” and though it has not been mechanically graded, it should[84]
be within easy grasp of upper first grade pupils, after the usual
Primer work is done. Each page of the book is a complete brief
story well suited to the daily lesson period. These short stories are
so related, however, as to make one continuous long story, thus keeping
the interest of the children keen throughout the book. Books of
this nature have proved a great stimulus to thoughtful and fluent
reading, which, after all, is the high aim in primary work.
