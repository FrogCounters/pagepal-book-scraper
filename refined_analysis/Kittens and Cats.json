    "When a new school Reader comes to the hands of the primary teacher, she naturally asks: \u201cWill this book give to my class of boys and girls a healthy stimulus of thought and pleasure?",
    "Will they receive through it valuable instruction and assistance in the mechanics of reading?",
    "Is the book sufficiently literary in style and artistic in form to command the respect and love of the children?",
    "Is it suggestive, dramatic, and ethically healthful?",
    "In a word, is it worth the precious time of the schoolroom?\u201d ",
    "\n",
    "To the inquiring teacher who may examine this little book, which is devoted entirely to the frolics and fancies of kittens and cats, the following remarks may reveal a definite educational purpose and value in it. ",
    "\n",
    "Following the example of Mother Goose, the wise and classic rhymester of the nursery, we have taken a subject dear to the heart of childhood and have given it life and personality in the simple and unsophisticated manner of the child. ",
    "\n",
    "Many of the happiest playtime experiences of children are associated with their kittens.",
    "They delight to dress the frolicsome yet docile little creatures in doll gowns and jackets, and give them long rides in doll carriages, and make them sit at tiny tables and share in tea parties, then put them to bed and perhaps give them water medicine for an imaginary ill.",
    "Can there be a more normal and healthy pastime for a little child than this? ",
    "\n",
    "In one respect kittens take precedence over dolls.",
    "They are _alive_.",
    "They _must_ be treated kindly.",
    "They will not bear the abuse and neglect given to many beautiful dolls.",
    "They demand attention and companionship, and they return a real devotion for kindness and care.",
    "Therefore we love them, and especially do our children love them and delight in stories or pictures of them. ",
    "\n",
    "Those of us who have had glimpses of the child heart and mind know that stories of kittens and queens and parties yield much the same delight to the little reader of juvenile fiction, as do adventure and romance to the grown-up reader. ",
    "\n",
    "This simple story about the Queen of the Kitten Country and the party which she gives in her palace, ought, therefore, to meet one of the most important requirements for a higher first grade school Reader, that of a strong appeal to the child in subject matter and illustration.",
    "With the interest keenly aroused the difficulties in learning to read are mastered quickly and with pleasure.",
    "However, the following brief suggestions are given to assist any teacher who may need them in making use of the book to the greatest advantage for her class. ",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SUGGESTIONS ",
    "\n",
    "Before the reading of the book is begun there might well be one or two story-telling periods.",
    "Each child should be encouraged to tell a story, from his own experience if possible, about a kitten, or a party, or to give his idea of a queen. ",
    "\n",
    "The children should be assisted in recalling and in learning Mother Goose rhymes and other verses about cats.",
    "Give them several blackboard drawing lessons showing cats in different positions and costumes.",
    "A frieze of kittens may be started at the top of the blackboard, adding each new kitten character to the row as the story progresses.",
    "This frieze will furnish material for several varieties of \u201cbusy work.\u201d ",
    "\n",
    "A valuable exercise to stimulate thought and facility of expression is to assign a short page for a child to read silently, which he later gives aloud in his own words before the teacher and class. ",
    "\n",
    "Interesting and profitable reviews may be frequently had by assigning a cat character to each child, having them read in order the text devoted to their special character.",
    "The first review of this kind may well occur at the end of page twenty, where the preparations for the party are completed.",
    "When the party is over a final review may be given in dramatic form.",
    "The children should impersonate the different cats and tell their tales to amuse the Queen, who sits on her throne.",
    "This final dramatic review would naturally begin with the call of the Commanding Officer on page twenty-two.",
    "Each child should memorize his part and give it with spontaneous expression and action.",
    "Slight costuming may be prepared if desired, or the blackboard frieze may furnish the cat pictures, while the children give life and action to them. ",
    "\n",
    "Other special and valuable reviews may be developed from the large amount of verse in the book, each child choosing a favorite verse to read or recite or to illustrate on the blackboard.",
    "The children should be encouraged to make rhyming sentences and word lists of their own, using the fundamental thought or words in the day\u2019s lesson as a basis.",
    "From such rhymes and lists of rhyming words, phonic work may be developed as the teacher chooses. ",
    "\n",
    "There are about six hundred words in the vocabulary of \u201cKittens and Cats,\u201d and though it has not been mechanically graded, it should be within easy grasp of upper first grade pupils, after the usual Primer work is done.",
    "Each page of the book is a complete brief story well suited to the daily lesson period.",
    "These short stories are so related, however, as to make one continuous long story, thus keeping the interest of the children keen throughout the book.",
    "Books of this nature have proved a great stimulus to thoughtful and fluent reading, which, after all, is the high aim in primary work. ",
